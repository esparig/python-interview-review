# Welcome to Python Interview Review

This notebook is intended to help you review some concepts (main data structures and algorithms) before a coding interview. 
Ideally you would review all this content and solve the example exercises, and then continue practicing using platforms like hackerrank or leetcode.

I also recommend some interesting books:
 * [Introduction to Algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms)
 * [Competitive Programming](https://cpbook.net/)
