    "\n",
    "* Bit-wise operators such as `6&4`, `1|2`, `8>>1`, `~0` (negative numbers are treated as theis 2's complement value), `15^x`...\n",
    "* Key methods for numeric types: `abs(n)`, `math.ceil(1/2)`, `math.floor(1/2)`, `min(x)`, `max(x)`, `pow(x, n)` or alternatively `x ** n`, and `math.sqrt(x)`.\n",
    "* Interconversions: `str(42)`, `int(\"42\")`, `float(\"3.14\")`.\n",
    "* Some useful numbers or expressions: `math.pi`, `math.e`, `float(\"inf\")`.\n",
    "* Some methods from random library: `random.randint(4, 10)`, `random.random()`, `random.shuffle(A)`, `random.choice(A)`, `random.choices(A, weights, k)`.\n",
    "* How to clear the lowermost set bit: `x & (x -1)`. Hence:\n",
    "  * Isolate the lowermost bit: `x & (x -1) ^ x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can additionally check the [built-in functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html), the [math library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html), and the [random library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html)."

    "## Arrays\n",
    "An array is a contiguous block of memory, usually used to represent sequences.\n",
    "Going through an array costs O(n), but retrieveing one element costs O(1).\n",
    "Filling an array from the front is slow, but very fast to do it from the back.\n",
    "Be careful when writing indexes used to go through subarrays, and with off-by-1 errors.\n",
    "In python an array uses the `list`type. Take into account that this type is immutable. \n",
    "Some important things to know:\n",
    "* Instantiate lists: `[1, 2, 3]`, or `[1] + [0] * 9`, or `list(range(100))`, or using list comprehension like `[math.exp(x) for x in range(10)]`.\n",
    "* Basic operations like `len(A)`, `A.append(x)`, `A.remove(elem)`, `A.insert(index, elem)`.\n",
    "* A 2D array is not necessarily a matrix: `A = [[2, 4, 6], [0], [1, 2]]`.\n",
    "* Be careful when copying a list: `B = A`doesn't create a copy, it's only another way of referring to list A. `B = list(A)` however constructs a new list B from the elements of A. Also important to know the differences between `copy.copy(A)`and `copy.deepcopy(A)`, see [copy](https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html) library.\n",
    "* Some key methods for lists are: `min(A)`, `max(A)`, binary search using [bisect](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html), `A.reverse()` (in-place), `reversed(A)` (returns an iterator), `A.sort()` (in-place), `sorted(A)` (returns a copy), `del A[i]` remove the i-th element from the list A...\n",
    "* Slicing is a very practical way of manipulating arrays, the general representation is `A[i:j:k]` where i is the initial index, j the end (excluding it), and k the step. And `A[-1]` returns the last element of A."
