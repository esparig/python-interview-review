    "* Instantiate lists: `[1, 2, 3]`, or `[1] + [0] * 9`, or `list(range(100))`, or using list comprehension like `[math.exp(x) for x in range(10)]`.\n",
    "* Basic operations like `len(A)`, `A.append(x)`, `A.remove(elem)`, `A.insert(index, elem)`.\n",
    "* A 2D array is not necessarily a matrix: `A = [[2, 4, 6], [0], [1, 2]]`.\n",
    "* Be careful when copying a list: `B = A`doesn't create a copy, it's only another way of referring to list A. `B = list(A)` however constructs a new list B from the elements of A. Also important to know the differences between `copy.copy(A)`and `copy.deepcopy(A)`, see [copy](https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html) library.\n",
    "* Some key methods for lists are: `min(A)`, `max(A)`, binary search using [bisect](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html), `A.reverse()` (in-place), `reversed(A)` (returns an iterator), `A.sort()` (in-place), `sorted(A)` (returns a copy), `del A[i]` remove the i-th element from the list A...\n",
    "* Slicing is a very practical way of manipulating arrays, the general representation is `A[i:j:k]` where i is the initial index, j the end (excluding it), and k the step. And `A[-1]` returns the last element of A."
